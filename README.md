This was built on a LONG deprecated version of Meteor, and never intended to be made public or edited by others. I would not expect for this codebase to be working at all at this time, however it is being made public so you can examine the logic for reconstructing a similar system.

Most of the logic for the needed features can be found in the server folder js files, most are held within serverMethods.js
